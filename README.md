# Project Title

**Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches for Heart Disease Prediction**

# Project Description

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict Heart Disease . The goal is to identify patient who has Heart Disease based on various physical condition and also find the best feature relate to the targeted featute.

# Data Sources

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 400k rows and 18 variables (9 booleans, 5 strings and 4 decimals) which is in csv format.

# Methodology

We used Python and various machine learning libraries, including Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, to preprocess the data, build and evaluate multiple models, and select the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, and recall. We incorporated feature engineering techniques, such as label encoding and feature scaling, to optimize model performance.

We split the data into training and testing sets and performed cross-validation to avoid overfitting. We evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics, including ROC-AUC, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

# Results

Our final model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 0.75. We visualized the feature importance of the model and found that the most important features for predicting attribute were the PhysicalHealth, DiffWalking, MentalHealth, Diabetic, PhysicalActivity, Stroke
